What is the status, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.?
##Context

What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?
##Decision

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?
##Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

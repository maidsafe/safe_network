# Safenode Manager

Safenode Manager is a command-line application for installing, managing, and operating `safenode` as a service.

It runs on Linux, macOS and Windows.

## Installation

The latest version can be installed via [safeup](https://github.com/maidsafe/safeup):
```
safeup node-manager
```

A binary can also be obtained for your platform from the releases in this repository.

## Nodes as Services

The primary use case for Safenode Manager is to setup `safenode` as a long-running background service, using the service infrastructure provided by the operating system.

### Create Services

First, use the `add` command to create some services:
```
$ sudo safenode-manager add --count 3 --peer /ip4/46.101.80.187/udp/58070/quic-v1/p2p/12D3KooWKgJQedzCxrp33u3dBD1mUZ9HTjEjgrxskEBvzoQWkRT9
```

This downloads the latest version of the `safenode` binary and creates three services that will initially connect to the specified peer. Soon, specification of a peer will not be required.

There are many arguments available for customising the service. For example, you can choose the port the node will run on, or the version of `safenode`. Run `safenode-manager add --help` to see all available options.

_Note_: elevated privileges are required for creating services, on all platforms.

Now run the `status` command:
```
$ safenode-manager status
=================================================
                Safenode Services
=================================================
Refreshing the node registry...
Service Name       Peer ID                                              Status  Connected Peers
safenode1          -                                                    ADDED               -
safenode2          -                                                    ADDED               -
safenode3          -                                                    ADDED               -
```

We can see the services have been added, but they are not running yet.

### Start Services

Use the `start` command to start each service:
```
$ sudo safenode-manager start
```

Providing no arguments will start all available services. If need be, it's possible to start services individually, using the `--service-name` argument.

With the services started, run the `status` command again:
```
$ safenode-manager status
=================================================
                Safenode Services
=================================================
Refreshing the node registry...
Service Name       Peer ID                                              Status  Connected Peers
safenode1          12D3KooWGQu92xCXuiK6AysbHn6kHyfXqyzNDxNGnnDTgd56eveq RUNNING              81
safenode2          12D3KooWQGVfcwrPFvC6PyCva1cJu8NZVhdZCuPHJ4vY79yuKC3A RUNNING              82
safenode3          12D3KooWMqRH6EF1Km61TAW9wTuv9LgDabKMY9DJSGyrxUafXP6b RUNNING              79
```

We can see our services are running and the nodes have connections to other peers.

Now, run the `status` command again, but with the `--details` flag:
```
=================================================
                Safenode Services

```

We get some more details for each node, including the path to its logs. Using the location provided, feel free to take a look at the logs being generated by the node.

The nodes could now be left running like this, but for the purposes of this guide, we will do some more things.

### Add More Nodes

It's possible to run the `add` command again, as before:
```
sudo safenode-manager add --count 3 --peer /ip4/46.101.80.187/udp/58070/quic-v1/p2p/12D3KooWKgJQedzCxrp33u3dBD1mUZ9HTjEjgrxskEBvzoQWkRT9
```

The subsequent `status` command will show us an additional three nodes, for a total of six:
```
$ safenode-manager status
=================================================
                Safenode Services
=================================================
Refreshing the node registry...

safenode4          -                                                    ADDED               -
safenode5          -                                                    ADDED               -

```

Again, the new nodes have not been started.

Run the `start` command to start them, then observe the status:
```
$ safenode-manager status

```

### Removing Nodes

If for some reason we want to remove one of our nodes, we can do so using the `remove` command.

Suppose we wanted to remove the 5th service. First of all, we need to stop the service. Run the following command:
```
$ sudo safenode-manager stop --service-name safenode5
```

Observe that `safenode5` has been stopped, but the others are still running:
```
$ safenode-manager status
=================================================
                Safenode Services
=================================================
Refreshing the node registry...

safenode2          12D3KooWQGVfcwrPFvC6PyCva1cJu8NZVhdZCuPHJ4vY79yuKC3A RUNNING               5

safenode4          12D3KooWLH9VRAoUMj4bUjtzcKS3mqfzyc46TxBkBzvUXfV1bjaT RUNNING               2
safenode5          12D3KooWEcbpvSSTmSyuzqP3gE9bE7uqYFatHhkJXr8PBiqmESEG STOPPED               -
safenode6          12D3KooWBip2g5FakT1dZHdrhdmnctgKqhbRBQA5ZpvtHh4XPRXJ RUNNING              29
```

Now that it's been stopped, remove it:
```
$ sudo safenode-manager remove --service-name safenode5
```

The `status` command will no longer show the service:
```
vagrant@ubuntu2204:~$ safenode-manager status

```

However, we will still see it in the detailed view:
```

## Upgrades

The node manager can be used to continually upgrade node services.

Suppose we have five services:
```
$ safenode-manager status
=================================================
                Safenode Services
=================================================
Refreshing the node registry...

```

Using the `--details` flag, we can see they are not at the latest version:
```
$ safenode-manager status --details

=================================================

PID: 3285
Data path: /var/safenode-manager/services/safenode1
Log path: /var/log/safenode/safenode1
Bin path: /var/safenode-manager/services/safenode1/safenode

<remaining output snipped>
```

For brevity, the remaining output is snipped, but the four others are also at `0.104.38`. At the time of writing, the latest version is `0.105.3`.

We can use the `upgrade` command to get each service on the latest version:
```
$ sudo safenode-manager upgrade
=================================================
           Upgrade Safenode Services
=================================================
Retrieving latest version of safenode...
Latest version is 0.105.3

✓ safenode2 upgraded from 0.104.38 to 0.105.3
✓ safenode3 upgraded from 0.104.38 to 0.105.3
✓ safenode4 upgraded from 0.104.38 to 0.105.3
✓ safenode5 upgraded from 0.104.38 to 0.105.3
```

Again, for brevity some output from the command was snipped, but the summary indicates that each service was upgraded from `0.104.38` to `0.105.3`.

As with other commands, if no arguments are supplied, `upgrade` operates over all services, but it's possible to use the `--service-name` or `--peer-id` arguments to upgrade specific services. Both those arguments can be used multiple times to operate over several services.

The node manager will determine the latest version of `safenode`, download it, then for each running service, if the service is older than the latest, it will stop it, copy the new binary over the old one, and start the service again.

### Downgrading

In some situations, it may be necessary to downgrade `safenode` to a previous version. The `upgrade` command supports this by providing `--version` and `--force` arguments. Each of those can be used to force the node manager to accept a lower version.

## Local Networks

Safenode Manager can also create local networks, which are useful for development or quick experimentation. In a local network, nodes will run as processes rather than services.

To create a local network, use the `run` command:
```
$ safenode-manager run
=================================================

_Note_: elevated privileges are not required for local networks.

```

So by default, 25 node processes have been launched, along with a faucet. The faucet dispenses tokens for use when uploading files. We can now run `safe` commands against the local network.

The most common scenario for using a local network is for development, but you can also use it to exercise a lot of features locally. For more details, please see the 'Using a Local Network' section of the [main README](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_network/tree/node-man-readme?tab=readme-ov-file#using-a-local-network).

Once you've finished, run `safenode-manager kill` to dispose the local network.

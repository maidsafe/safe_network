## Installation
You can install the Autonomi CLI in two ways: by directly downloading the binary from GitHub or by building it from source using a terminal.

### Option 1: Downloading the Binary from GitHub

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/maidsafe/autonomi/releases) page on GitHub.
2. Download the latest release for your operating system.
3. Extract the downloaded archive.
4. Move the binary to a directory included in your system's PATH.

### Option 2: Build locally

1. Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your machine. You can download them from rust-lang.org
2. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/maidsafe/autonomi.git
cd autonomi
```
3. Build the CLI:
```
cargo build --release --bin=ant
```
4. Add the CLI to your PATH / Environment Variables
#### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
$env:PATH += ";C:\path\to\your\binary"
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $env:PATH + ";C:\path\to\your\binary", [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
```

#### macOS and Linux (Bash)
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/binary
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/binary' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Reference

### Specify the logging output destination.
```
--log-output-dest <LOG_OUTPUT_DEST>
```

Default value: `data-dir`\
Valid values: [`stdout` , `data-dir` , <custom path\>]

The data directory location is platform specific:
| OS  | Path |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Linux | $HOME/.local/share/autonomi/client/logs |
| macOS | $HOME/Library/Application Support/autonomi/client/logs |
| Windows | %AppData%\autonomi\client\logs |

### Specify the logging format.
```
--log-format <LOG_FORMAT>
```   
Valid values [`default` , `json`]

If the argument is not used, the default format will be applied.

### Specify the Connection Timeout
```
--timeout <CONNECTION_TIMEOUT>
```  

Default value: `120`\
Valid values: [`0 - 999`]

The maximum duration to wait for a connection to the network before timing out.\
This value is expressed in seconds.

### Prevent verification of data storage on the network.
```
-x, --no-verify
```  
This may increase operation speed, but offers no guarantees that operations were successful.


### File Operations

#### Get a cost estimate for storing a file
```
file cost <file>
```

Gets a cost estimate for uploading a file to the network.
This returns both the storage costs and gas fees for the file.

Expected value: 
- `<file>`: File path (accessible by current user)


#### Upload a file
```
file upload <file> [--public]
```
Uploads a file to the network.

Expected value: 
- `<file>`: File path (accessible by current user)

The following flag can be added:
`--public` (Optional) Specifying this will make this file publicly available to anyone on the network

#### Download a file
```
file download <addr> <dest_path>
```
Download a file from network address to output path

Expected values: 
- `<addr>`: The network address of a file
- `<dest_path>`: The output path to download the file to


#### List the files in a vault
```
file list
```
Lists all files (both public and private) in a vault.


### Vault Operations

#### Get a cost estimate for storing a vault on the network
```
vault cost
```
Gets a cost estimate for uploading a vault to the network.
This returns both the storage costs and gas fees for the vault.

#### Create a new vault and upload to the network
```
vault create
```
Creates a new vault and uploads it to the network.
This will initialise a new vault in the local storage and then upload it to the network.

#### Load vault from the network
```
vault load
```
Retrieves data from the network and writes it to local storage.
This will download the vault data from the network and synchronise it with the local storage.

#### Sync local data with the network
```
vault sync [--force]
```
Sync the users local data with the network vault data.

The following flag can be applied:
`--force` (Optional) Add this flag to overwrite data in the vault with local user data

### Wallet Operations
#### Create a new wallet
```
wallet create [--no-password] 
```

You will be prompted for an optional password, ignoring this will not encrypt the wallet.
This will output the private key for the wallet, the public key for the wallet, and the stored location on device.

The following flags can be used to explictly include or exclude encryption of the created wallet

`--no-password` (Optional) Add this flag to skip the password prompt and encryption step. \
`--password <password>` (Optional) Add this flag to encrypt the create wallet

Note on wallet security
Encrypted wallets provide an additional layer of security, requiring a password to read the private key and perform transactions. However, ensure you remember your password; losing it may result in the inability to access your encrypted wallet.

#### Imports an existing wallet from a private key
```
wallet import <private_key>
```

The following flags can be used to explictly include or exclude encryption of the imported wallet

`--no-password` (Optional) Add this flag to skip the password prompt and encryption step. \
`--password <password>` (Optional) Add this flag to encrypt the create wallet


#### Displays the wallet balance
```
wallet balance
```
This will display both the token and gas balances.

#### Display the wallet details
```
wallet export
```
This will display both the address and private key of the wallet.


## Error Handling
If you encounter any errors while using the CLI, you can use the `--log-output-dest` and `--log-format` options to specify logging details. This can help with debugging and understanding the behavior of the CLI.
